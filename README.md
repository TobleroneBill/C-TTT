# C-TTT
Tic Tac Toe in c++ terminal

Just to test out the c++ basics.
Hope to modify HL1 code so i can create a cool FPS game, or learn sdl/openGL so i can make my own 2d mario rip off.
Obvz thats far in the future, but this was just a taster of how it feels to use c++ (no memory management yet lol)
